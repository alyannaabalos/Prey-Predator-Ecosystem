# Prey-Predator-Ecosystem

The Cat-Mouse predator ecosystem tries to simulate a farm ecosystem where mice run around, acting like pests and eating produce, while cats roam around and try to hunt them. 

As hinted, the cats act as the predators in this scenario while the mice act as the prey. The mice can run run around and take sharp turns, preventing their hunters from catching them while the cats can also move around and leap for extra distance to catch up to their prey.

Both rely on energies to live. The mice feed on the produce while the cats feed on the mice. Both are also able to reproduce but with different requirements. For cats, they must have an energy level of more than 80 to attempt reproduction while mice only have a 60-energy level requirement. Moreover, aside from the cats and mice reproducing, the produce can also regrow after a certain amount of time.
